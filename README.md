# TFMCA_server
Simple server for the tfmca project

This is a server for the TFMCA project our group is doing as the practice assignment for our Object-Oriented programming course.
As the project is supposed to find actual use after the assignment I didn't want to only simulate server behaviour within the app,
thus we needed a server. I don't have any prior experience with SQL, JDBC or even server-client relations and the deadline is rather
tight so the whole server integration is just patching together a million tutorials and thus code quality is generally even worse than
my other projects.

This whole thing will probably see at least a partial rewrite after the assignment is turned in and I can continue the development of the
app for my own use without time limits.

If anyone happens to stumble upon this without knowing what the main project is, it can be found in here:

Constructive criticism is welcome.
